        <h2>The best meteorite tracker out there!</h2>
        <P class="stdParagraph">
            Welcome to our meteorite tracking app for Android! We are passionate about space and astronomy,
            and we created this app to help you explore the fascinating world of meteorites. Our app uses
            data provided by NASA to track meteorites as they enter the Earth's atmosphere.
            <br><br>
            This app is perfect for all you science and space nerds out there looking for an app
            that accurately tracks and filters meteorites for you.
            <br><br>
            You can use the app to view real-time data on meteorite sightings and locations. Whether you
            are a professional astronomer or simply curious about the world around you, our app has something
            for everyone. This app was created by a passionate CS student at Högskolan i Skövde who is dedicated to
            bringing the wonders of space to the palm of your hand. Our app is designed to be easy to use,
            with a simple and intuitive interface that allows you to quickly access the information you need.
            <br><br>
            We are committed to providing the most accurate and detailed information possible, and I am
            constantly improving our algorithms to ensure that our data is up-to-date and trustworthy.
            Thank you for choosing our meteorite tracking app for Android. I hope that you enjoy using it
            as much as I enjoyed creating it!
